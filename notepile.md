  * "if you REALLY want to optimize, the thing you need to know is that any executable file on your path whose filename starts with git- becomes a git command.
For instance, if you have a script called git-pr which automatically generates a PR from your current commit, you can add git-pr to your path and then using git just type git pr and it'll execute that script.
then you can alias it to gpr or whatever to really save time :wink:"
