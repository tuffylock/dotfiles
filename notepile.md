* myk git scripts: https://github.com/mbilokonsky/mit
  * "if you REALLY want to optimize, the thing you need to know is that any executable file on your path whose filename starts with git- becomes a git command.
For instance, if you have a script called git-pr which automatically generates a PR from your current commit, you can add git-pr to your path and then using git just type git pr and it'll execute that script.
then you can alias it to gpr or whatever to really save time :wink:"

* bundle exec bin/rake, etc
  *
  * bundle exec ensures you're triggering commands from gems in your Gemfile. may not be that useful for rails command but is definitely needed for rake for instance.
  * the first thing the rails command does is load up bundler and check which version of the command to execute. So you'd really just be slowing yourself down to involve bundler in the first place when running the rails command.
  * So, at the end of the day there's no difference. But considering the fact that Rails goes through the trouble of shipping its own binstubs, I'd favor bin/rails alternative. Also, it autocompletes better.
  * If you use the --binstubs flag in bundle install, Bundler will automatically create a directory (which defaults to app_root/bin) containing all of the executables available from gems in the bundle.
  * After using --binstubs, bin/rspec spec/my_spec.rb is identical to bundle exec rspec spec/my_spec.rb.
  * Binstubs may also include other customizations like loading spring gem, which preloads and speeds up the Rails application.
  * x
  * rake and rails work for db commands ?? does rails need bundle exec in that case?
    * https://stackoverflow.com/a/23846736/5598661
    * So for most commands you'll want to run bundle exec <command> to make sure you're running the right version for your project (and also to make sure that all dependencies are also loaded from the correct versions specified in your Gemfile.lock). The one notorious exception to this rule is the rails command. The reason being that the first thing the rails command does is load up bundler and check which version of the command to execute. So you'd really just be slowing yourself down to involve bundler in the first place when running the rails command.

    * So which is faster to run? rake for actual rake tasks, as it'll bypass the extra logic in needing to determine it was being passed rake arguments. But also rails specific arguments cannot be ran with rake e.g. bundle exec rake generate will not work (unless you have a generate task). If in doubt, run bundle exec rails --help and in at least Rails v5, it'll output which arguments are rails specific and which are rake specific.

* ssh

* oh my zsh ?

  * https://stackabuse.com/pimp-my-terminal-an-introduction-to-oh-my-zsh/
  * has up key history contextual to typed characters
  * don't have to use cd for directory navigation?
    * Oh My Zsh also supports dynamic path completion, so typing (for example) /h/j/De and pressing Tab will expand the path to /home/jim/Desktop.


* command line shell
  * https://stackoverflow.com/a/64316750/5598661
  * When you are at a command line, typing in commands and reading output you are working in a program called a terminal (or console on windows). The terminal is taking your commands and forwarding them to a program, called a shell, who's job is to actually execute the commands you type in to the terminal and possibly print some output. The output from the shell is then displayed in your terminal window.
  * The terminal is like the web browser and the shell is like the javascript engine. Your browser takes your input (click, keypresses, mousemoves) and sends them along to javascript which processes those actions and the browser displays the results.
